Social Media Messaging App

This app allows you to securely message your friends whenever you want! It allows you to request new friends, start conversations with them, and send messages in real-time.

Getting started:
- First you'll need to login or sign up if you haven't created an account yet (Note: all user information is securely encrypted and stored in our database)
- Once you've logged in you can add new friends by clicking on the plus friends logo in the top-left. You can now search for friends based on their names and add them
- Once your friend has accepted your request you'll see their name pop up in the left column
- You can remove a friend at any time by clicking on the red x
- To start a new chat simply click on the friends name and start texting

Security was a priority of this project so I ensured to integrate end-to-end encryption for all user messages send and received. The messages are also send with authentication codes to ensure integrity. Moreover, user passwords are hashed and stored securely to ensure your information stays safe!
